# The Fundamental Theorem of Everything!


## Arithmetic
Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factored into prime numbers up to the order of factors.

## Algebra

Every non-zero, single-variable polynomial of degree n with complex coefficients has exactly n complex roots counted with multiplicity.

## Calculus

Let F be an antiderivative of f. Then (integration of f from a to b) = F(b) - F(a)

## Computable Analysis

Every computable real function is continuous.
